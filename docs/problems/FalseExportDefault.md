# ‚ùóÔ∏è Incorrect default export

The resolved types use `export default` where the JavaScript file appears to use `module.exports =`. This will cause TypeScript under the `node16` module mode to think an extra `.default` property access is required, but that will likely fail at runtime. These types should use `export =` instead of `export default`.

## Explanation

This problem occurs when a CommonJS JavaScript file appears to use an assignment pattern like `module.exports = something` where the corresponding type declarations say `export default something`. The correct syntax for the type declarations to use would be `export = something`. As shown in the following table, when `export default something` describes a CommonJS module, it describes the type of `module.exports.default`, not `module.exports` itself.

| JavaScript syntax | Type declaration syntax |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| `module.exports = x` | `export = x` |
| `exports.default = x; exports.__esModule = true` | `export default x` |
| `export default x` | `export default x` |

## Consequences

Consumers using `--moduleResolution node16` or `nodenext` will see incorrect TypeScript errors when importing the module from an ES module:

```ts
import mod from "pkg";
mod();
// ^^ This expression is not callable.
// Type 'typeof import("pkg")' has no call signatures.
```

This error appears even though the code is correct at runtime. The TypeScript error can be resolved by changing the code to access the `.default` property of the import:

```ts
import mod from "pkg";
mod.default(); // üí•
```

However, this likely crashes at runtime. The types misrepresent the runtime module in a way that makes it impossible to satisfy both Node and TypeScript at the same time.

This problem is typically only apparent to users under `--moduleResolution node16` or `nodenext` in ESM files. In many bundlers, as well as in files that will be transformed to CommonJS with `esModuleInterop` enabled, a default import can be used to access a CommonJS module‚Äôs `exports.default` provided it exposes an `exports.__esModule`, so the inaccuracy of the typings is not easily observable. But in ES modules in Node, an imported CommonJS module‚Äôs `__esModule` export has no special meaning, so accessing its `exports.default` will always require an additional `.default` property access on the default import. This lack of special interop behavior in Node is only reflected in TypeScript‚Äôs `node16` and `nodenext` modes, so users in other modes may be unaffected.

## Common causes

This problem is usually caused by library authors incorrectly hand-authoring declaration files to match existing JavaScript rather than generating JavaScript and type declarations from TypeScript with `tsc`.
