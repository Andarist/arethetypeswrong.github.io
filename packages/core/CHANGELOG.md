## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d107355: - New problem kind: **Internal resolution error** indicates that an import in one of the packageâ€™s type declaration files failed to resolve. Either this indicates that runtime resolution errors will occur, or (more likely) the types misrepresent the contents of the JavaScript files.
  - Significant API changes. Most significantly, problems are returned as part of `checkPackage`, and `summarizeProblems`/`getSummarizedProblems` have been replaced by a collection of utilities for grouping and filtering problems.
