# @arethetypeswrong/cli

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d107355: New problem kind: **Internal resolution error** indicates that an import in one of the packageâ€™s type declaration files failed to resolve. Either this indicates that runtime resolution errors will occur, or (more likely) the types misrepresent the contents of the JavaScript files.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d107355]
  - @arethetypeswrong/core@0.1.0
